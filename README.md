# Assembly-Language

I used Microsoft Visual Studio to program this language.
- build project -> start debug -> go down each line until it reaches the end
<br>

Notes:
- Bytes - 8 bits (AH, BH, CH, DH, AL, BL, CL, or DL)
- Words - 16 bits (AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, SP, or BP
- Doublewords (dword) - 32 bits (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, ESP, or EBP)
- Quadwords - 64 bits
- Segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, and GS)
<br>

- AND - if both are 1, output is 1; otherwise, it's 0
- OR - if both are 0, then output is 0, otherwise, it's 1
- XOR - if both are same, then output is 0, otherwise, it's 1
